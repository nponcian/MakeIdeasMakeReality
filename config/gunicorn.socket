# Symlink this file to /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket

# A tool that is starting to be common on linux systems is Systemd. It is a system services manager
# that allows for strict process management, resources and permissions control.

# Below are configurations files and instructions for using systemd to create a unix socket for
# incoming Gunicorn requests. Systemd will listen on this socket and start gunicorn automatically in
# response to traffic. Later in this section are instructions for configuring Nginx to forward web
# traffic to the newly created unix socket

# Next enable and start the socket (it will autostart at boot too):
#     systemctl enable --now gunicorn.socket

# In the rare case that you need to find out the service main pid, you can use
#     systemctl show --value -p MainPID gunicorn.service
# or simply one in the list of (normally the first)
#     ps aux | grep gunicorn
# but if you only want to send a signal an even better option is
#     systemctl kill -s HUP gunicorn.service.

# www-data is the default nginx user in debian, other distriburions use different users (for
# example: http or nginx).

# You must now configure your web proxy to send traffic to the new Gunicorn socket. Edit your
# nginx.conf to include the following:
#     proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;

[Unit]
Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
# These options may be specified more than once, in which case incoming traffic on any of the sockets
# will trigger service activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to the service, regardless of
# whether there is incoming traffic on them or not.
# More than 1 ListenStream could be active at the same time. Here I have disabled listening to
# port 8002 to avoid direct access to Gunicorn server as all requests should go to Nginx first.
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock
# ListenStream=0.0.0.0:8002

# Our service won't need permissions for the socket, since it
# inherits the file descriptor by socket activation
# only the nginx daemon will need access to the socket
User=www-data
# Optionally restrict the socket permissions even more.
# Mode=600
