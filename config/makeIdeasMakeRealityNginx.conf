# Now make sure you enable the nginx service so it automatically starts at boot:
#     systemctl enable nginx.service
# Either reboot, or start Nginx with the following command:
#     systemctl start nginx

#     systemctl restart nginx

# No need to add "http" block as this is just included as part of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
#     user www-data;

# Example configuration below. The target web server to forward the HTTP Request to via proxy_pass
# can be another server, not necessarily localhost. This is applicable if Gunicorn server lives in
# another server different from where Nginx server is running.
#     server {
#     listen      80;
#     server_name example.org;
#     access_log  /var/log/nginx/example.log;

server {
    # The port indicated in listen is where Nginx will listen to. This means that no other
    # application under the same device should listen on that port, not even Gunicorn nor the Django
    # built-in WSGIServer as that would produce an error. So if Nginx and Gunicorn lives on the same
    # device and Nginx is set here to listen on port 8000, which Gunicorn also does by default, then
    # you should either:
    #     1. Change the port to where gunicorn would listen to for requests through --bind (if using
    #        gunicorn command line), bind (if using gunicorn.conf.py), ListenStream (if using Systemd),
    #        etc. and then set Nginx to forward the request to the updated gunicorn listening port.
    #     2. Instead of forwarding the request to another port where Gunicorn is listening, just use
    #        a Unix socket file as the medium of communication between Nginx and Gunicorn. Set a
    #        socket to where Gunicorn would listen to for requests and then set Nginx to forward
    #        requests to that socket. This is the better way because with this, you do not need to
    #        configure Gunicorn to listen on a particular port from where not only Nginx could send
    #        requests to it but potentially anybody else outside the network, rendering Nginx and
    #        its security useless.
    # To verify if what server sent the response, whether it is Nginx server or Gunicorn server,
    # inspect elements from the browser and see the HTTP Response Headers "server" field. Ideally
    # everything should be from Nginx server and no one should be able to directly access and send
    # request to the Gunicorn server.

    # Keep in mind that whatever path you put in here to where the static files are stored is
    # possible to be accessed by "others" (the "o" in the Linux u-g-o permissions):
    # 1. Each directory and subdirectory in the path should have at least an execute (x) permission
    #    to be able to gain access to the next level of subdirectory in the path, with the last
    #    subdirectory able to access files (or further subdirectories as indicated in the URL
    #    request) within it. While r (read) is is not required, it may actually be preferred
    #    particularly on the last subdirectory as it is the one that will be exposed to the outside
    #    world to avoid possibility of listing files/directories on it.
    #    Example:
    #        URL = http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/
    #        Equivalent location = /var/www/makeIdeasMakeReality/
    #    Commands:
    #        chmod o+x /var/ /var/wwww/ /var/wwww/makeIdeasMakeReality/
    # 2. The file to be served has at least a "read" permission.
    #    Example:
    #        URL = http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/home/assets/img/homeJumbotron.jpg
    #        Equivalent location = /var/www/makeIdeasMakeReality/home/assets/img/homeJumbotron.jpg

    #        chmod o+r /var/www/makeIdeasMakeReality/home/assets/img/homeJumbotron.jpg

    # Gunicorn 19 introduced a breaking change concerning how REMOTE_ADDR is handled. Previous to
    # Gunicorn 19 this was set to the value of X-Forwarded-For if received from a trusted proxy.
    # However, this was not in compliance with RFC 3875 which is why the REMOTE_ADDR is now the IP
    # address of the proxy and not the actual user.
    # To have access logs indicate the actual user IP when proxied, set access_log_format with a
    # format which includes X-Forwarded-For. For example, this format uses X-Forwarded-For in place
    # of REMOTE_ADDR:
    #     %({x-forwarded-for}i)s %(l)s %(u)s %(t)s "%(r)s" %(s)s %(b)s "%(f)s" "%(a)s"
    # It is also worth noting that the REMOTE_ADDR will be completely empty if you bind Gunicorn to
    # a UNIX socket and not a TCP host:port tuple.
